PyDendro
========

The PyDendro project provides a set of open source tools for analysis
ring with measurements.

PyDendro consists of two main parts:

* A set of Python modules to read and write ring width measurements
  and perform some basic manipulations.  These are helpful for
  creating your own batch processing scripts in Python.

* A graphical user interface to visualize ring width measurements and
  perform basic manipulations.

PyDendo can be downloaded from the `PyDendro project page`_.  It is in
the very early stages of development: comments, suggestions, and
contributions are welcome!  Please contact `Matthew Emmett`_ if you
have any questions.
